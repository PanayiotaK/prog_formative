  <h1>Computer Science in Science</h1>
  <p>Computer science can be used to help model complicated systems, such as the Earth's atmosphere or the universe,
    which allows scientists to demonstrate and quickly test their hypotheses. Computers can process a large amount of
   data, which is useful for scientific research requiring lots of computation on a dataset. The field of data science
   uses scientific processes to extract information from data using methods including machine learning; this data can
   be used in scientific research.</p>
