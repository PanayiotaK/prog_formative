		<h1><center>Computer Science in Health Care</center></h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Current interest in health informatics is centred upon the use of a service-based broker to gather information. The IBHIS project (Integration Broker for Heterogeneous Information Sources), involving collaboration between the Universities of Durham, Keele and Manchester demonstrated how software service architectures (another major research interest) can be employed to enable access to information held and owned by autonomous, independent agencies in the healthcare domain. Current research is centred upon providing information about patients with blackouts to ambulance control, with the aim of improving the effective use of ambulance and crew, as well as a better experience for the patient.

		<h2>Key Uses</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Computed tomography (CT) Scans</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Makes use of computer-processed combinations of many X-ray measurements taken from different angles to produce cross-sectional (tomographic) images</li>
				<li>Digital geometry processing is used to further generate a three-dimensional volume of the inside of the object from a large series of two-dimensional radiographic images taken around a single axis of rotation.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Databases</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Access patient information quickly</li>
				<li>Continuity of healthcare between hospitals</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Computer Simulations for testing drugs</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Development of new software which can predict the possible cardiac side effects of taking a new drug</li>
				<li>More accurate than current animal testing</li>
				<li>Reduce animal suffering</li>
			</ul>
