Interest of content: Sound
Quite heavy material on the index page. More like listing facts than engaging reader- not very interesting. However, there is a lot of content on the history of computer science. Although the title is ‘a brief history’, I wouldn’t go as far as saying the description is ‘brief.’ Getting wikipedia copy paste vibes.
On the ‘Computer Science in Health Care’ page it is quite interesting how the author has mentioned Durham University, adding a personal aspect to the page. I like how key uses of computer science in healthcare have been highlighted briefly. 
On the ‘Computer Science in Science’ page, the detail is not very heavy, making the page easy to understand even for those not proficient in the subject. I absolutely love how the author has referenced the Ariane 5 disaster, as if I could forget. Content is a bit lacking, however.
The ‘Computer Science in the Future’ page is the most informative. Content is definitely the most interesting out of all pages.

Consistency and quality of visual presentation: Very Good
There is a consistent colour scheme throughout the site: blue, navy blue and purple. I definitely applaud the consistency. However, the colours do clash a bit and the colour scheme could have been better chosen. The fonts are also consistent and are nice and formal.

Quality of written presentation: Very good
I like the use of bullet points throughout the site. It makes content clearer. Some of the paragraphs, e.g. on the index page, are a bit heavy and difficult to plough through.
